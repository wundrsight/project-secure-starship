Project Code Name: Secure Starship

Project Title: Building a HIPAA Compliant Extended Reality App Platform (Open Source)

About Project: 
The goal of this project is to create a HIPAA compliant system for virtual reality (VR) applications that handles all aspects of data security. With the increasing use of VR technology in healthcare, it is essential to ensure that all patient data remains secure and protected in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). To accomplish this, we will work closely with healthcare professionals to understand the specific requirements and needs of VR applications in a healthcare setting. This will involve conducting research on existing HIPAA regulations and best practices, as well as identifying potential vulnerabilities and risks associated with VR technology. Once these requirements have been identified, we will design and build a custom HIPAA compliant system specifically for VR applications. This system will include measures such as secure data storage and transmission, authentication and access controls, and regular security testing to ensure that patient data remains protected at all times. In addition to building the HIPAA compliant system, we will also provide training and support to healthcare professionals to ensure that they are able to use the VR applications safely and effectively. This will include guidance on how to properly handle patient data and maintain the security of the system. Overall, the aim of this project is to provide a reliable and secure platform for VR applications in healthcare, ensuring that patient data is protected and that healthcare professionals can confidently use VR technology to improve patient care.
